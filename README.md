# BouncingBallClass

In this project you will write a program using [Processing](https://processing.org) that displays five bouncing balls. You must create a Ball class and create five instances of the class. You may add additional functionality (color, bounding of each other, etc). 

When you are happy with the appearance of your virtual pet, you will post your finished program on a website. You can get a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account for your website. Instructions on how to put your program on a GitHub website are on slides 73-86 of the [apjavaProcessing slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sqbareaFmF9fMcp0XOl3hRO6hAlrU5WIaj4V-Kd3eDI/edit?usp=sharing). Submit the link to your website on google classroom.
